Repo for both Data Science class projects


The first project consists in creating a different dissimilarity measure for the ADULT and MNIST datasets. 
We then tested this dissimilarity measure using multiple ML algorithms to evaluate its performance

On the other hand, the second project consisted of a heavy labor data cleanup and analysis, in which we studied
multiple statistics concerning all of the countries in the world, trying to find correlations between the data 
as well as making predictions.
